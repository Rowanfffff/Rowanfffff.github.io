			<h2>1. Interstellar</h2>
			<img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/300505.jpg">
			<p>Interstellar is my favorite sci-fi movie of all time! This movie not only contains a lot of sci-fi movie elements: wormholes, black holes, space adventures, multi-dimensional space, but also human affection and love. No matter from which angle, it touches me deeply. I was impressed by how small the most advanced human space station is compared to the vast unknown of the universe and the infinite details of the wormhole, especially after Endurance reaches the unknown galaxy and flies into the huge black hole “Gargantua”, which is just a small black dot that can be almost ignored under the contrast of the bright radiation of the black hole.</p>

			<h2>2. The Butterfly Effect</h2>

			<p>When watching the Butterfly Effect made me gain a lot of ideas. In our daily lives, we often fantasize about changing things in the past to make ourselves better in the present. This movie is a good reaction to the consequences of this. In the movie, there is a man named Evan who keeps changing his past choices in the hope of finding a perfect future, but in the end, it doesn't work out the way he wants it to.</p>

			<h2>3. The Godfather</h2>
			<img src="https://wallpapers.com/images/hd/the-godfather-quotes-uy0n70s0osoismke.jpg">
			<p>There are two places in this movie that have left a deep impression on me, one is the cold revenge, and the other is the warmth of family love. I have always dreamed of being able to have the supremacy of words like Godfather Corleone when I am about to age, and even more so, I dreamed of having a happy family with a lot of joy.</p>

			<h2>4. Titanic</h2>
			<img src="https://images.hdqwalls.com/wallpapers/kate-winslet-leonardo-dicaprio-in-titanic-ia.jpg">
			<p>To this day, Titanic is a blockbuster that blows me away every time I see it, whether it's the love story of Jack and Rose, the grandeur of the setting, or the theme song that I can't get enough of.</p>

		<div class="col21-1">
			<h2>5. Coco</h2>
			<img src="https://images.alphacoders.com/872/872458.jpg">
			<p>One of the details that touched me the most is that at the end of the movie, Coco, who is already 100 years old, although her hair is all white, still wears the same two pigtails as when she was a child, and when she is reunited with her father in the underworld, she innocently calls out to him as when she was a child, and he kindly takes her by the hand, even though she looks older than he does, but the picture is not out of place! I think that no matter how many years have passed. I think that no matter how many years have passed since she became a parent or even a great-grandmother, she can always be a child in front of her father.</p>
